Fig. 1. Simulated response of a mammalian inner hair cell (IHC) to sound stimuli across 20–20,000 Hz, the human auditory range. Each subplot shows the variation in basolateral membrane potential over an 80 ms period in response to a half-wave rectified sinusoidal input current (i.e., a sine wave with negative values set to zero), following the approach of López-Poveda & Eustaquio-Martín (2006). Stimulus frequencies are: (a) 20 Hz, (b) 200 Hz, (c) 2,000 Hz, and (d) 20,000 Hz. The membrane voltage exhibits a transition from oscillatory (AC-like) to steady (DC-like) behavior, with reduced amplitude at higher frequencies. Model parameters were drawn from López-Poveda & Eustaquio-Martín (2006) and Rattay et al. (1998), and differential equations were solved using the Euler method.
